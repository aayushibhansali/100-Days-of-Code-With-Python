<h1>Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Code challenge!</h1> 
This is a journey where i commit to learning and coding with Python consistently for the next 100 days. 
The 100 Days of Python Code challenge is all about dedicating time every day for the next 100 days to learn, practice, and create with Python.
Throughout the challenge, i'll work on a variety of projects and coding exercises that cover different aspects of Python programming. These projects will gradually increase in complexity, allowing me to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios. By the end of the 100 days, i'll have a collection of projects that showcase my progress and serve as a testament to my commitment.
